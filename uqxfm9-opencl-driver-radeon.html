You are probably missing the native OpenCL runtime or driver for your platform. AMD GPUs on Windows require this runtime and/or driver: "AMD Radeon Software Crimson Edition" (15.12 or later) Intel CPUs require this runtime and/or driver: "OpenCL Runtime for Intel Core and Intel.  On a Windows 10 system with an AMD Radeon GPU and an Intel GPU (desktop or notebook), with graphics drivers installed for both GPUs, I bet you will see that OpenCL is limited to the AMD GPU only. If you search for Intel OpenCL related files with Explorer or Regedit, you will quickly. Ah here we are, with AMD it's trickiest! The most important thing is that your system must be clean of NVIDIA display driver residues. If, like me, you have both ATI and NVIDIA drivers on your system, the GPU code path of AMD's OpenCL won't work.

This tool is designed to detect the model of AMD graphics card and the version of Microsoft® Windows© installed in your system, and then provide the option to download and install the latest official AMD driver. Getting your Windows machine ready for OpenCL is rather straightforward. In short, you only need the latest drivers for your OpenCL. I am looking to purchase a new graphics card to start working on neural networks and GPGPU projects Which is a better overall choice, does the amount of on-card ram make a difference?

I'm thinking about buying a Radeon VII, but I'm concerned about the current state of AMD OpenCL drivers. Here's my thinking: 1. We have to use old drivers due to OpenCL compiler bug. 2. Brand new Radeon VII card probably won't be supported by old drivers, right? 3. Attempting to use cached binary files won't work since mining software will see this as a new card. Mining software will just compile kernels, resulting in bad binaries. Am I missing something? What are your thoughts. Free Download AMD Catalyst OpenCL 2.0 Graphics Driver 14.41 RC1 for Windows 8.1 64-bit (Graphics Board). I noticed several folks are already selling their SaberPC pre-order slots on eBay and Panjo.

AMD has released its first fully-functional OpenCL 2.0 driver aimed at early adopter developers. We're not broadly promoting this driver because we have a performance-optimized driver coming out shortly and we suggest you wait for that version. The Intel® Graphics Compute Runtime for OpenCL™ Driver depends on the i915 kernel driver. Necessary i915 features are available with relatively recent Linux kernels. The recommended kernel is the validation kernel cited in github documentation. ATI AMD Radeon — драйверы, видеокарты, компьютеры. Новости, тесты, обзоры, справочники, программы. 
For some context, I'm an OpenGL and OpenCL developer, and I also do a lot of work with scientific computing and massively parallel architectures. For the past 5 years, I've been a complete NVIDIA fanboy for their linux support and good OpenGL support, along with CUDA. I've also been interested in Intel because they have the best wireless chipsets. However, for a number of reasons lately I am re-considering that relationship: AMD seems to be better for both price and cost, and as a developer. I am planning on upgrading my current video card, which is a radeon. Could anyone tell me the pros/cons between the two brands. I currently have an ATi HD5770 card and it works ok but I'd like to get something with a little bit more oomph. I don't play much games, do watch a lot of HD video in various formats, cost really not a factor. I'm currently running quite a bit of a hybrid OS. I still have Ubuntu 11.10 but with kernel 3.8.10 compiled from source and with the latest binary Ati driver 13.4, CPU is a 12 core Intel Extreme Edition, "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU X 980 @ 3.33GHz" Any suggestions and experi. ampgt; What will you be doing with this PC?

I have a question regarding a gaming pc that isn’t too fancy just something that will last me a bit and that I can play the games I have on. I was at Costco the other day and saw this pc it looked pretty good to me, much better than what I have currently. I’m wondering if it will serve my needs adequately or if I should get some help from you guys building something. I am trying to update my OpenCL Drivers but i cannot find out how to do it.

OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a new heterogeneous computing environment, that runs on the CUDA architecture. It will allow developers to harness the massive parallel computing power of NVIDIA GPU's to create compelling computing applications. First off, it may be worth mentioning that this gpu, or at least the one in my system, doesn't get detected or work at all without a driver installed. Hence, I can only use the onboard graphics in the meantime. With Windows 7, I could just run the AMD auto detection utility to detect the gpu and install the drivers, and it would work.

My line of work means I am editing a lot of 4K-8K footage, including 8K Red raw footage. I will need to significantly improve the Mac's capabilities in this regard meaning RAM upgrade and a GPU. Being Apple, I am limited to the AMD GPU line-up although I use DaVinci so the OpenCL platform is better for me anyway.

Hello everyone. I just finished troubleshooting my R9 290 which would have screen flickering after installing the drivers. I used MSI afterburner to lower RAM frequency to 1,100 MHz  (Factory is 1260 MHz). My problem seems to have left and it survived 10 minutes of stress tests, so as far as I know, the card is stable. I can do further stress testing if needed. I'm trying to put it to work on XMR-Stak. I'll launch XMR stak, it does the startup thing, then the screen freezes for a few second.
